# Boston_Housing_Prices
 Our task is to build an optimal model based on a statistical analysis with the tools available. The model will then be used to estimate the best selling price for the clients' homes.
 
 You can download the Housing_analysis.ipnb file and run it on the python notebook. Feel free to play around with the code. I have tried to make the notebook as simple to read as possible.
